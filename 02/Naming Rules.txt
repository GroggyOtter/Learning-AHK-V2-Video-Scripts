Naming rules for AHK v2:

Info can be found here:
https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Concepts.htm#names

These naming conventions apply to EVERYTHING in AutoHotkey:
- Variables
- Functions
- Window groups
- Classes
- Properties
- Methods

Max name size:
253

Allowed characters:
- Alphabetic characters
  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

- Numbers:
  0123456789

- Special characters:
  The _ (Underscore) character is the only useable special ASCII char
  Any unicode character past the first 127 ASCII chars can be used

Rules to remember:
  - The first character must never be a number
  - AHK is not a strictly typed lanugage (capitals and lowercase are the same)
    - The varaibles "Num" "NUM" and "num" are all the same variable
  - There is a list of reserved words that should never be used
    - That list of words is covered below

List of reserved words (not to be used as variable names):
  - AND
  - as
  - Break
  - Catch
  - contains
  - Continue
  - Else
  - false
  - Finally
  - For
  - Global
  - Goto
  - If
  - in
  - is
  - IsSet
  - Local
  - Loop
  - NOT
  - OR
  - Return
  - Static
  - super
  - Throw
  - true
  - Try
  - unset
  - Until
  - While


Examples of short but meaningful variable names:
str := "smaller strings"
txt := 'larger strings'
num := 3.14159
arr := ['array', 'example']
obj := {a:"an", b:"object", c:"example"}
mp  := Map("m","Map", "e","Example")

Single character varaibles aren't normally a good idea.
However, they can be smart things to utilize in 1-time-use scenarios
When using a for-loop to iterate through an array or map, the variables
you define are only applicable inside of that loop.
Things like i, k, and v (representing index, key, and value) make sense
because you won't need them later/can't use them later.

arr := ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
For i, v in arr
    MsgBox(i ":" v)

mp := map("a","alpha", "b","beta", "g","gamma")
For k, v in mp
    MsgBox(k ":" v)
